## Technologies Used
Calcont Whiteboard is primarily built on React.js. To simplify canvas implementation, we use Fabric.js. You can find the documentation for Fabric.js [here](http://fabricjs.com/docs/) .
Additionally, we use Material-UI and Font Awesome for UI components and icons respectively. You can find their links below:
